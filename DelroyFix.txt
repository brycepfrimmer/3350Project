There are a few changed files where I can't tell you what lines you changed.
This is because the files are all marked as -<some 1000> lines of code and then +<some 1000> lines of code.
I'm not sure how you did this but git is reading the file as completely replaced plus a few extra lines.
The difference between the - and + is all I can tell you. If you didn't edit some
of these files I'm not sure what got inserted...

I manually checked the conflicting files in the merge with a compare tool in Notepad++
Files:
src/cmmsObjects/Vehicle
src/cmmsPresentation/AddPart.java
src/cmmsPresentation/AddVehicle.java
src/cmmsPresentation/EditPartsList.java
Please double check the changes
