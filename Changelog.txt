	* Reverted back to accessing the database through Interface.java
	* Created an interface "CMMSInterface.java" that stores an instance of
	Interface.java that can be accessed by all necessary classes
	* CMMSInterface.java also has enums to erase the need of a few magic
	numbers that were consistent between a few classes
	* Updated access to all necessary classes
	* Removed (commented out) the search controls from the main interface as they
	aren't functional yet
	* Can Edit Vehicles by selecting -ONE- vehicle and hitting edit
		* Selecting None or Multiple will result in a MessageBox
	* Can View Vehicles by selecting One or Multiple Vehicles and hitting view
		* Selecting None will result in a MessageBox
