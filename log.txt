ITERATION 1

Meeting 1 - Tuesday, January 28, 2014
Discussed where to put log... Determined our TODO list through discussion. We decided that there were a few things we
needed to do right away in order for project work later on to go smoothly. These are the items nearer the top of the list.
We tried to organize the list roughly by importance/what we needed to do first. We also set dates to have the base of our
code done so that further work could be continued by all. Below are the notes taken during the meeting on what was
discussed and required. We also set up our Developer task list for the work to be done after the base code was in place.
This included a rough shot at who was to be in charge of what. Our task list was comprised entirely of smaller parts of
our user stories and assumed that the project was already set up on Git and was at a place that work could be contributed.
TODO
- set up Git - get Github accounts and email/FB/Text Bryce username
- learn to use Git
- learn to use SWT & Windows Builder
- set up base code - Main Screen (GUI), classes/objects, readme of all contents for submission
- Need thorough testing, need stub DB (array list?)
- one week approx. start GUI (Feb. 4th)
- start today basic class files (Jan 28th)
- start setting up DB (Feb 4th?)
- Need batch files for testing...
STUFF TO LEARN
- GIT!
- SWT (install)
- JUNIT
- Windows Builder (download) drag & drop tool

Meeting 2 - Tuesday, February 4, 2014
We started off by making sure everyone was on git and reasonably comfortable enough to commit and push
changes to the project. We finalized the folder structure of our project and created Eclipse .project
and .classpath files so that everyone would be on the same page. We rationalized that aside from the GUI
portion of the project, we would need a Vehicle, Parts List, and Insurance Policy classes. These were
decided upon while we brainstormed what exactly would need to be included information wise for each vehicle.
In our vehicle class, what we ended up deciding upon is included. This changed slightly as we were initially
building our project but solidified once we ready to integrate the vehicle information into the GUI portion.
At this point in the meeting we naturally began to break off into a couple of groups to begin working.
One group began implementing the class structure we would need while the other played around with Windows
Builder to create the start of our CMMS GUI. After approximately two hours we pushed all updates to the
Git repository and set our next meeting for the Thursday of the same week.

Meeting 3 - Thursday, February 6, 2014
Met and continue to work on our class structure. To clarify ideas we drafted a rough outline for the required
classes. Breaking off into a few smaller groups we then also began working on creating a stub database and
continued our work on the main GUI. At this point we needed to decide exactly how our GUI was going to tie into
the structure our Vehicles. We considered a few different ways of displaying the information (Blocks in a grid,
labeled by ID) but decided upon a list view where each aspect of the vehicle was listed horizontally beside the
vehicle ID. After about 2 hours we called the meeting for the night and set the next meeting for next week Tuesday.
NOTE: between people's scheduling and the state that our project was at we decided that a meeting wouldn't be
required. We continued to work communicating through our group chat.

BUGS
No detected bugs. Room for improvement in error checking in business classes and interface, and how they communicate and 
complement each other. In addition:
	- On main screen, disable buttons when there is no selection instead of throwing a notification error when they do select it
	- Fix sizing along the top of the list view in the main window to show all of the text in each column
	- Add a "Quit" or "Close" button on the view vehicle screen
	- layout to add/edit vehicle & possible combine them??
=======
"Big" User Stories for Iteration 2:
Time or Usage based tracking - 5 days
Searching - 3 days
Modifying Vehicle adding criteria - 5 days
Daily Tasks - 3 days

For more detail please see "User Stories.pdf"

Other Tasks for Iteration 2:
- Implement SQL database - 3 days
- Implement integration tests

The four Big user stories listed above are the next four in our list and are the four that we intended to implement in iteration 2.
As of right now our initial plan hasn't changed at all. This might be different over this next iteration.

ITERATION 2

Meeting 1 - Tuesday, February 25, 2014
Met up for 30 minutes, discussed the small issues in Iteration 1 (see above BUGS) & determined who was going to work on what for the current
iteration. Set the next meeting for next Tuesday with the goal of having most of the code working by then. Discussed possibly moving
some of the Stories from Iteration 3 up to this iteration but decided that we would finish the Stories for Iteration 2 before doing so.
Set the task list.

Developer Task List - Iteration 2
1 - Implement HSQLDB - 3 days - Zac
2 - Implement integration tests and expanding unit tests - 4 days - Delroy
3 - Add in time or usage based tracking - 5 days - Bryce
4 - Add in search functionality - 3 days - Darwin
5 - Include modification of vehicle addition criteria - 5 days - Cody
6 - Fix small issues from Iteration 1 (see BUGS section in Iteration 1 Summary) - 1 day - Darwin
7 - Look into hiding/displaying certain columns in the main GUI list view - 1 day - Darwin
8 - 
9 - 
10- 
11- Create test classes for project - on going - ALL

****NOTE: this task list is merely a start. Other than a couple of them they are "Big" user stories and will need to be broken down into smaller
tasks. Please perform this breakdown as you see fit as you are working on that section of the program. By no means is this set in stone. Do what
you can, whatever is left we can handle as a group.
