3350Project
===========

Little program that outputs a intro message stating the program, designers/developers, and copyright.

Folder structure:

	-> src is for *.java files
	-> obj is for *.class files
	
This structure let's us seperate java from class files. Class files are compiled into the obj folder 
by running 

	javac -d {path/to/folder} {*.java files}

and the program is run by running (currently) CMMS from
the obj folder.
